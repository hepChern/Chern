    VObject:
    # Methods:
        + __init__:
            It should be initialized with a absolute path.
            The initialization gets variable "path" and "config_file".
            It is quite light-weight to create a VObject.
            A VObject can be abandoned after using
            and create another when needed.

        + __str__, __repr__:
            For print

        + invariant_path:
            Return the path relative to the project root
        + relative_path(a_path);
            Return the path of the VObject relative to a_path

        + object_type:
            Return the type of the object: project,
            task, directory, or empty("")
        + is_zombine
            To judge whether this object has a type

        + color_tag: (Maybe put it somewhere else?)
            For print

        + ls:
            Realization of "ls" call o.ls()
            will give you the contents of the object

        + add_arc_from(obj)
        + remove_arc_from(obj, single=False)
        + add_arc_to(obj)
        + remove_arc_from(obj, single=False):
            Add or remove arcs,
            the "single" variable is only used for debug usage.

        + successors
        + predecessors:
            Get [objects]
        + has_successor(obj)
        + has_predessor(obj)
            Judge whether obj is the succ/pred of this obj

        + doctor:
            Judge whether it is a good object(with all arc linked)

        + copy_to:
            Copy the object and its contains to a new path. Before the copy,
            all objects in the directory will be impressed.
            The arcs within the directory will be kept
            and outsides will be removed.
        + clean_impressions
        + clean_flow:
            Helpers for copy_to

        + path_to_alias
        + alias_to_path
        + has_alias
        + set_alias
        + remove_alias

        + move_to:
            Move the object to another directory

        + rm:
            Remove the object

        + impression:
            Return the impression of the object
        + impress:
            Make a impression
        + is_impressed:
            Judge whether this object is impressed

        + pack_impression:
        + unpack_impression:
        + is_packed:
            For future transfer purpose
