# Chern

## Introduction
Chern is a program intended to simplify the progress of physics analysis.
It provides the following features:
+ Project management:
+ Work flow:

### Tasks and algorithms
The key concept of Chern project are tasks and algorithms.
An analysis is usually divided into many small steps, for instance, one of which might be fit in a specific bin. Many such small steps will use a same program but only different parameters or inputs. We call the steps **task** and the programs **algorithms**. What you need to do about the analysis is simply to setting parameters and start tasks.

## Installation
I don't know either, but you can try this: `git@github.com:zhaomr13/Chern.git`

## Usage

### Configuration
+ `Chern config`: edit the global configuration file for all the projects, the default editor is nano 

### About project management
+ `Chern projects`: list all the current projects
    * `Chern projects config`: config the current project
    * `Chern projects [project]`: change the current project to [project] and jump its root directory, if the [project] doesn't exists, it will 
+ `Chern tasks`:
